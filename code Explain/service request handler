Summary
Each route in REQUEST_ROUTE_HANDLER_MAP specifies a URL path and the corresponding HTTP methods (GET or POST) along with the handler functions that process the requests. These handlers perform various actions like requesting and verifying OTPs, retrieving and adding addresses, raising and canceling service tickets, and updating user settings.
